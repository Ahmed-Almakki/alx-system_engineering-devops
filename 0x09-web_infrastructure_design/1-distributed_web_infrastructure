*For every additional element, why you are adding it:
	the two servers to improve performance and apply redundency, and the load balancer so to don't overload,
	 one server and now we can distribute the incomming traffics

*What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works:
	Round Robin, requests are distributed evenly between servers

*Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both:
	Active-Active, active-active all servers are running simultaneously and handling requests,
	 while active-passive there is one avtive server while the other in idle mode ready to be used if something happen

*How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works.
	A Primary-Replica setup configures one server to act as the Primary server and the other server to act as a Replica of the Primary server

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works:
	database A called the primary (master) and database B called replica (slave)
	praimary database deals with write operation while replica database deals with read operation

Issue with infrusturcture:

*-SPOF:
	if the Primary database server is down, the entire site would be unable to make changes to the site.

*-security issues.
	The data transmitted over the network isn't encrypted using an SSL certificate so hackers can spy on the network.

*-No monitoring.
	We have no way of knowing the status of each server since they're not being monitored.
