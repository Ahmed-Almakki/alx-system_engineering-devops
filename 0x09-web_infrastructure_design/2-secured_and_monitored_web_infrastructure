1- The purpose of the firewalls.
	The firewalls are for protecting the network (web servers, anyway) from unwanted and unauthorized users.

2- The purpose of the SSL certificate.
	The SSL certificate is for encrypting the traffic between the web servers and the external network.

3- The purpose of the monitoring clients.
	The monitoring clients are for monitoring the servers and the external network.


Issues With This Infrastructure
*-Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
	Terminating SSL at the load balancer level would leave the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers unencrypted.

*-Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
	Having one MySQL server is an issue because it is not scalable and can act as a single point of failure for the web infrastructure.
*-Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
	Having servers with all the same components would make the components contend for resources on the server like CPU, Memory, I/O, etc.,
	 which can lead to poor performance and also make it difficult to locate the source of the problem. A setup such as this is not easily scalable.
